# TIZIM_02 — Construction OS Master Roadmap

Authoritative domain map so nothing disappears between sessions.
Last reconciled: 2026-09-01 · main `b6db686` · release candidate `6a6f0d1`
(READY_FOR_OWNER_APPROVAL_V2).

Status legend: **LIVE** (in production) · **SOURCE_READY** (code on a branch/main,
not deployed) · **PARTIAL** · **MISSING** · **BLOCKED** · **DEFERRED-P1/P2/P3**.

Canonical law: ONE ENTITY — ONE ID — ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH — MANY VIEWS.
Supabase = business truth · private R2 = file truth · Drive/Sheets = replicas ·
GAS = bridge.

## Domain status

| Domain | Status | Canonical entity | Current source of truth | Gap / next vertical slice | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Auth / session | **LIVE** | User, Sess | Cloudflare `functions/api/sessiya` + cookie | Fail-closed secret audit (SEC H1) | — |
| Company / tenant | **LIVE** | `t2_kompaniya`, `t2_azolik` | Supabase | Company create/onboarding flow audit; company settings surface | Auth |
| Director / owner model | **SOURCE_READY** | `t2_azolik.rol='boss'` = director | Supabase (`20260905120000`) | `t2_kompaniya_yarat_v1` makes the creator a `boss`; `t2_men_v1.is_director`. Distinct `director` vs `boss` label deferred-P2 | Company |
| Membership / roles / permissions | **SOURCE_READY** | `t2_azolik` | Supabase + RLS + command guards (`20260905120000`) | Director-guarded `t2_azolik_qosh_v1`/`_rol_ozgartir_v1`/`_ochir_v1`; superadmin never grantable; last-director protected; soft-cancel. Invite-code flow deferred-P1 | Company |
| Subscription / billing / entitlements / quotas | **MISSING** | Subscription, Plan, Entitlement | — | Backlog contract only; `codex/storage-quota-ui-v1` waits here. NOT in this release (no fake payment) | Company |
| Onboarding (multi-tenant safety) | **SOURCE_READY** | `t2_kirish_royxatga_ol` | Supabase (`20260905120000`) | **P0 fixed**: new user no longer auto-joins every active company; `t2_royxat_sorov_qabul_v2` provisions company+director atomically | Auth, Company |
| Company settings / profile | **MISSING** | — | — | Minimal settings page | Company |
| Projects | **LIVE** | `t2_loyiha` | Supabase (`t2_loyiha_royxat`) | — | Company |
| Participants / project network | **PARTIAL→wired** | `t2_loyiha_qatnashchi` | Supabase (`t2_loyiha_qatnashchilar_royxat`) | `/admin/participants` reads real data (this release); invite/accept + email state = DEFERRED-P1 | Projects, ENT contract |

| Storage (canonical folders) | **LIVE** | `t2_company_storage_workspace` / `_project_storage_binding` / `_object_storage_binding` | Supabase + GAS bridge → Drive | Storage screen relabel: Drive = replica, not "asosiy storage" (PHASE G, in this release note) | — |
| File truth (documents) | **SOURCE_READY** | `t2_document_registry` (canonical R2 cols), `t2_replica_sync_job` | private R2 + Supabase (after migration) | Apply `20260902/06/07/08120000` + private `R2_CANONICAL` bucket + Cloudflare deploy (runbook) | Storage |
| Document Center UI | **SOURCE_READY** (wired) | `t2_document_registry_v1` | Supabase + Codex `DocumentCenter` | `/admin/documents` renders the real registry (or honest "not applied" until migrations ship); download → private R2 | File truth |
| Drive replica worker + write-back | **SOURCE_READY** | `t2_replica_sync_job` + `98_T2ReplicaSync.js` | — | rename/**move**/delete write-back done (move = managed re-bind to KNOWN binding, else conflict+review); GAS trigger + `REPLICA_SYNC_SECRET`; content write-back R2 copy-in = DEFERRED-P1 | File truth |
| Sheets replica / write-back | **SOURCE_READY (reference)** | `sheets_entity_id`, `base_version`, `operation_id` | Supabase (`20260908120000`) + `99_T2SheetsReplica.js` | `t2_document_sheets_writeback_v1` = the reusable template (row number never identity). Legacy per-sheet write-backs DEFERRED-P1 | File truth |
| Boss / director panel | **SOURCE_READY** (was FAIL) | `t2_boss_dashboard_v1` read model | Supabase views | Apply migration; wire more cards as domains canonicalize | many read models |

## Immediate sequence (next 2–3 releases)

1. **This release** (`6a6f0d1` → main after approval): FILE-TRUTH deploy + Boss
   panel + **CTRL-001 real** + **company/auth/director P0** + **Document Center
   real** + **Drive move write-back** + **Sheets reference** + **SECURITY P0
   (auth fail-closed)** + App identity + participants real-read.
2. **P1-A**: Drive replica worker + Sheets worker GAS deploy + triggers;
   controlled Drive backfill pilot (separate approval).
3. **P1-B**: content write-back R2 copy-in (Drive→R2 new revision, currently a
   review job); invite-code onboarding flow + notifications.
4. **P1-C**: full security review (H2 service-role negative tests at the DB,
   H5 audit completeness, session rotation).
5. **P2**: contracts single-truth, procurement lineage, warehouse consolidation,
   finance lineage, schedule, design control, quality/safety.
6. **P3**: Universal Estimate Engine, design system, AI assistants, country packs,
   subscription commercialization (no fake payment until then).
